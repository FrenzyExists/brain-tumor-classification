# Imaging

Second project of the headstarter Acceleration program

Just like the second project, its divided in two parts

Part one:
- Downloading the dataset
- Understanding the dataset
- Preprocessing the dataset
- Training the Transfer Learning model
- Training the CNN model
- Evaluating th models

Part two
- Building the web app
    - Creatinhgthe UI and visualizations
    - Generating explanations of the MRI scan using Gemini 1.5 flash

Yep, this is using generative AI

this uses multi-LLMs to understand and predict brain tumors in MRA scans

This is very obvious for many, for the reptilians posing as humans out there, a Brain Tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain  that could be benigh or malignant. When its malignant, congrants, you have cancer. Jokes aside, its of everyone's interest to be able to diagnose brain tumors as early as possible since that can reduce the risks of benigh tumors turn malignant and treat patients to evade health complications 

MRIs are Magnetic Resonance Image. Its kinda like radiology, but we use magnets instead of blasting you radioactive 

Some tumors could be glioma, meningioma, pituitary or no tumor

gliocoma starts on the glio cells, 30% of the most common ones around. supports and nutrients brain cells
 
 this is a clasification project btw
